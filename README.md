Web Frontend Developers

[] some of you may have heard of roadmap.sh , built entirely on a community effort.
   today we're going to be defining some sort of approaches from it as our authorized learning standards.
   on roadmap.sh, you can surely find much larger pathway to get stick on frontend development.
   but what our learning standards execute is the patterns or maybe just a framework,
   which we're going to be using for our future desired projects.
   so, you must make sure learning focused on the standards we describe.
